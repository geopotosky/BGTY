# BGTY-Final

======
README
======


“Be Good To Yourself” is a straightforward event tracker and countdown App. User can add as many events as they want. Events are automatically saved after they are created/edited.  The app includes the ability to create ToDo lists and budget sheets for each event. Users can add their event to their local calendar and share them with social media apps.  Finally, BGTY includes a special feature called the “MG” Coefficient, which visually removes 2 days from the overall countdown; the first days, which really doesn’t count, and the final day, which also really doesn’t count, especially if you are excited and really to be good to yourself.

“MG” Coefficient

“MG” also known as the MG Coefficient is a very unique countdown element not available in any other countdown App.

Button Values:

•	MG OFF: Displays the standard countdown values.

•	MG ON: Take 1 day off the front of the count and 1 day off the end of the count. 

If you exit out the scene and go back, MG will be reset to OFF.

After all, do we really include those days when we are counting down to a special event? ☺
