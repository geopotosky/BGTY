BGTY README
===========


“Be Good To Yourself” is a straightforward event tracker and countdown App. User can add as many events as they want. Events are automatically saved after they are created/edited.  The app includes the ability to create ToDo lists and budget sheets for each event. Users can add their event to their local calendar and share them with social media apps.  Finally, BGTY includes a special feature called the Magic Wand. Originally called the “MG” Coefficient, the magic wand visually removes 2 days from the overall countdown; the first day, which is the current day and really doesn’t count, and the final day, which also really doesn’t count, especially if you are excited and really to be good to yourself.

Countdown Scene
---------------

BeGoodShowViewController.swift

“Until” display:
----------------

Tap one of the time elements (Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds) to change the UNTIL counter based on your selection. Both the Main and UNTIL countdown dynamically update 1 second at a time.  Note: If the event date has less than 1 week left, the “Weeks” element will automatically grey out/not be selectable. And so on for each time element.


--------------
The Magic Wand
--------------

The Magic Wand method, previously known as the MG Coefficient, is a very unique countdown element not available in any other countdown App. This fun method:
•	removes the 1st day of the event counter. Reasoning is the 1st day has already started and doesn’t really count (as part of the countdown when using the MG Coefficient.
•	removes the final day of the event counter. Reasoning is the last day is considered part of the event day (as part of countdown when using the MG Coefficient.

Magic Wand Button Values:

•	Magic Wand OFF: Displays the standard countdown values.

•	Magic Wand ON: Take 1 day off the front of the count and 1 day off the end of the count. 

•	NOTE: the Magic Wand button will be automatically disabled if the event date is less than 2 days away from current date.

If you exit out the scene and go back, the Magic Wand will be reset to OFF.

After all, do we really include those 2 days when we are counting down to a special event? ☺
